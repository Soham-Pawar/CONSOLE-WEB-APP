        <h3><b>Why is Visual Studio Code?</b></h3>
        <h4>Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling,<br>
             like IntelliSense code completion and debugging. First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out
             of your way.<br> The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your
              environment, and more<br> time executing on your ideas.</h4>
         
              <h3><b>WEB CONSOLE:</b></h3>
              <h4>Web Console is a web-based application that allows end-users to manage their data. ... In addition,
                   Web Console<br> allows you to run reports, download software packages, and manage virtual machines, among
                    other operations..</h4>
